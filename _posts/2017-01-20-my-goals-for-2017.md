This is the 3rd year that my first post on this blog is about what goals I accomplished last year and what will be the ones of that year.  

First things first, this is my first post written in english and from now on they will be all written like this.  

So, let's start talking about my last year goals. You can se them here: [Goals for 2016](https://wenndersantos.github.io/off-topic-metas-para-2016/)  

## Did I meet my 2016 goals?  

#### 1 - Buy an electric pressure cooker: Ok!  
<blockquote>Funy? hahaha I wanted to prepare my own food and in most part of the year I got it. Besides saving money, I have fed better.</blockquote>  

#### 2 - Go to the doctor and do tests: Not ok!  
<blockquote>I went to the dermatologist, but I needed to return and I didn`t went. I also need to do a general checkup.</blockquote>  

#### 3 - Be cool with people: (I dont know, maybe Ok!)  
<blockquote>I felt I could be cooler with people. I tried... hard! Seriously, I think most of the time I got.</blockquote>  

#### 4 - Read a book per month: Ok!  
<blockquote>More than ok! I Readed 25 books last year. You can see the list on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/47524351?shelf=read">my GoodReads.</a></blockquote>  

#### 5 - Spend less money: Not ok!

## What is this?
  This is my personal blog, here I write things about my carrer, lectures that I gave and technologies that I use my day.

## Who I am?
  I am Wennder, a software developer that always want to learn something new. But, not just only learn, I want to use it! So, if you are working with those cool new things, please let me work a few hours with you :)

  I have been working with software development for about 5 years, most of this time using tecnologies like C# and javascript
  (you can see my skills on the [skills session](#skills))

  Communities of technology are in my blood, I am always present in meetups, conferences and hangouts whether watching, organizing or given lectures.

  I am part of two communities programs, one of them is the [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001694?fullName=Wennder%20%20dos%20Santos) and the other is [ALM Rangers](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalmrangers/2017/02/27/introducing-the-visual-studio-alm-rangers-wennder-dos-santos/).

Microsoft build is one of the biggests Microsoft`s conference. In this conference, they show lots of new technologies, frameworks and products.
In this year, 2017, I decide to write this post to put two things that I did to show the things that I liked in this year conference.

The first one is a podcast about the entire conference and second one is an slide presentation from a lecture that I gave about the xamarin related news.

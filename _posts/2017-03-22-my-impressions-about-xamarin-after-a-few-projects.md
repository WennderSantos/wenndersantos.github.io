Hi everyone!

This is my first blog post about Xamarin.

Until now, I wrote a lot of about hybrid mobile technologies. But, if you thought I was just doing things whith those frameworks... you are totaly wrong.

I'll tell you what I think about Xamarin after a few projects and why I don't like to compare it to hybrid frameworks like those cordova based.

## About Xamarin
I need to confess to you, at the beginning I dint't like Xamarin. But, you have to agree with me. Why I would like?

I tried to use two year ago and... I needed to write the views two times (Android and iOS) I didn't want to do that in a multiplataform framework. So, after that experience I passed some time just saying: "I dont't like Xamarin because it don't offer me the benefits that Cordova offers". I was wrong when I did these comparisons, I just didn't know yet (I'll tell you why I was wrong, keep reading).

In the middle of the last year I discovered Xamarin Forms. Things started to change about the "need to write the views two times" and I kind of started liking Xamarin.

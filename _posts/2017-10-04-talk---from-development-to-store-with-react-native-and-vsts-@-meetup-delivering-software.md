Hey guys!

Yesterday I was at [Lambda3](https://www.lambda3.com.br/) participating in the meetup [Develivering Software](https://www.meetup.com/DeliveringSoftware/)

I gave a talk called "From development to store with React Native and VSTS". Yes, the talk was in pt-BR.

You can see the deck that I used below:

I recorded my talk using hangouts, you can see the video below:

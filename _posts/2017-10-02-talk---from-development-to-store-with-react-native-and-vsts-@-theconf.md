Hey!

Last week I gave my first English lecture. I was so nervous, but I liked so much!

The lecture was in an international conference called [TheConf](http://www.theconf.club/). It was its first edition.

You can see more about TheConf below:

[THE CONF - 2017 Edition Report](http://www.akitaonrails.com/2017/10/02/the-conf-2017-edition-report)

My talk was "From development to store with React Native and VSTS". The main objective of this talk was to show how to we can use React Native and VSTS together.

You can see the deck that I used below:

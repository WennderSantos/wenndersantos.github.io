Hi everyone!
This is my first blog post about Xamarin.
Until now, I wrote a lot of about hybrid mobile technologies. But, if you thought I was just doing things whith those frameworks... you are totaly wrong.
I'll tell you what I think about Xamarin after a few projects and why I don't like to compare it to hybrid frameworks like those cordova based.

## Keep in touch, this post is being written

Some days ago, I was in contact with [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/).   
Why?  
I was trying to become a PluralSight author.  
After years consuming video content there, I felt like putting my content there too. But, I did not pass on the audition in this time.  
I'll explain how it works the process to become a PluralSight author and tell you why I didn't get in.  

## What motivated me?
As I said before, I want to publish part of the content that I produce on PluralSight.  
I have some reasons to want that, two of them are:
  * Sharing content in a place that lots of people will see
  * Marketing myself as a developer/consultant abroad  


After read the [post](http://www.andrealveslima.com.br/blog/index.php/2014/02/19/6-motivos-para-eu-ter-sido-reprovado-na-audicao-da-pluralsight/) written by André, I decided to apply myself as an author.  
To become an author, technological knowledge is not the most important thing that you has to know.


## The process
The process starts when you apply yourself to become an author on this [link](https://www.pluralsight.com/teach). To apply yourself is very simple, just fill the form. You need to inform the content audience of the course you are thinking about. I didn't like the content audience part, because the topics are too much generic.


After a couple of days, someone from pluralsight sent me an email saying that the type of content that I chose had already too many authors and good courses. I replied the email explaining more specifically about what I wanted to say. After that, they were interested on my course.  

If PluralSight has interest in your content, the conversation will continue. They are very attentive and the process is very professional.  

I had a call with a guy called Matt and he explained me a lot of things and the next step, the audition.

## Why dind't I get it?


You can see my audition on this video:

I'll try again in a few weeks and, of course, I'will write the result here on my blog. So, stay in touch :)


See you on the next post!

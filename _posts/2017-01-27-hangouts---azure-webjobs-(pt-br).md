Hey everyone!

Some days ago, I was invited to present something related to Microsoft Azure on an online event called [Azure Tech Nights](azuretechnights.azurewebsites.net).
I had just a few days to build a presentation, so I decided to call a friend to present with me.  
We had a thing in common, both of us had been work with Azure WebJobs for about a year. With no doubts, we choose WebJobs to be the theme of our talk.  
You can see the result rigth below on the hangouts.

Some days ago, I was in contact with [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/).   
Why?  
I was trying to become a PluralSight author.  
After years consuming video content there, I felt like to putting my content there too. But, I dit not pass on the audition in this time.  
 I'll explain you how the it works the process to become an author and tell you why I didn't got it.  

## What motivates me?


## The process


## Why I dind't got it


You can see my audition on this video:

I'll try again in a few weeks and, of course, I'will write the result here on my blog. So, stay in touch :)


See you on the next post!

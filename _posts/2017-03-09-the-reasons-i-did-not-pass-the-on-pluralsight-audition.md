Some days ago, I was in contact with [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/).   
Why?  
I was trying to become a PluralSight author.  
After years consuming video content there, I felt like to putting my content there too. But, I did not pass on the audition in this time.  
I'll explain how it works the process to become a PluralSight author and tell you why I didn't get it.  

## What motivated me?
As I said before, I want to publish part of the content that I produce on PluralSight.  
I have some reasons to want that, two of them are:
  * Sharing content in a place that lots of people will see
  * Marketing myself as a developer/consultant abroad  


After read the [post](http://www.andrealveslima.com.br/blog/index.php/2014/02/19/6-motivos-para-eu-ter-sido-reprovado-na-audicao-da-pluralsight/) written by André, I decided to apply myself as an author.  
To become an author, technological knowledge is not the most important thing that you has to know.


## The process
The process starts when you apply yourself to become an author on this [link](https://www.pluralsight.com/teach). To apply yourself is very simple, just fill the form. You need to inform the content audience of the course you are thinking about. I didn't like the content audience part, because to topics are to much generic.


After two days, someone from PluralSight sent me an email tell me that the content audience that had inform on the form has already a lot of good courses and authors. I respond the email tell the specific content of the course that wanted to publish. After that, they become interested in my course.  

If PluralSight has interest in your content, the conversation will continue. They are very attentive and the process is very professional.  

I had a call with a guy called Matt and he explains me a lot of things and the next step, the audition.

I'll try again in a few weeks and, of course, I'will write the result here on my blog. So, stay in touch :)


See you on the next post!

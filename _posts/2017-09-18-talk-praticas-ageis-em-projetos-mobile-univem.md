Last week, I was at [Univem](http://www.univem.edu.br/) to give a lecture about automation, agile methods and devops in mobile projects. The title was "Agile practices in mobile projects".

This was my first presentation with this title and I liked the result.

The storytelling was a real story, using myself as an example. I started talking about how I usually did stuff and how I do now. In parallel I was showing the benefits of change and improve our work.

Check out the slides that I used in this presentation:
